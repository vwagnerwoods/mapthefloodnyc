          boardwalk, which runs nearly the entire length of the nation’s largest
          urban beach is gone — the concrete pillars that held up the wood
          structure are all that’s left of the icon of the Rockaways. Sections
          of the boardwalk, with lampposts and benches still attached, now sit
          along sand-covered Shore Front Parkway and lodged on side streets, as
          far as Rockaway Beach Boulevard in some places."</i

          Rockaway and the post-storm scene in other parts of the city. While
          just a few miles inland, stores were open and bustling, and people
          were going about their business as though nothing had happened,
          residents of Rockaway were gathering on the beach, where waves had
          ripped the boardwalk from its concrete mooring and smashed it into the
          beachfront homes. "</i

        <i
          >"After Sandy, relief funds served the more affluent sections of the
          peninsula, leaving many poor residents unable to rebuild or remain. A
          study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice comparing Rockaway’s
          post-storm recovery to that of low-income communities in Manhattan’s
          Lower East Side found that the latter neighborhood was better able to
          advocate for funds, thanks to established network of
          anti-gentrification activism. Isolated and segregated, the Rockaways
          experienced more of a shock. <br /> Today, the most rapidly changing
          section—the blocks with the board shops, wine bars, and $120
          hand-stitched swimsuits—is smack in the middle of the peninsula. In
          spite of the persistent hurricane threat, home prices have gone up and
          up since Sandy. While plenty of year-rounders welcome the amenities
          and economic boost, it’s an uneasy balance for others. In 2014, a
          young rapper named Sean Blaise released a music video lambasting the
          'Nazi pizzerias' and 'white bro' taco stands that were supplanting the
          businesses he knew from his youth. 'It all centers around this
          idealized vision of a beach community. They turned it into some
          behemoth fake paradise of surf culture and fish tacos,' he told
          Gothamist at the time."</i
