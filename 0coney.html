          >"During the early evening of Monday, October 29, Hurricane Sandy
          reached Coney Island. With her, she brought a 14-foot storm surge,
          which drove the waves of the Atlantic Ocean over the sands of Coney
          Island Beach, over the wooden planks of the boardwalk, through the
          rides, games and attractions of the amusement parks, and onto Surf
          Avenue. By 7 PM, the streets were desolate. Just before 8 o’clock,
          power went out. At 9, seawater was covering cars. [...] Flood water
          had forced vehicles onto the sidewalks and, in a few cases, crushed
          them against trees and utility polls. If a window or windshield hadn’t
          been broken, condensation from water pooled inside the car collected
          on the glass, creating the impression of past lives. Many times, the
          owners had scribbled insurance information on the front or back
          windshield, which, in an odd way, made the vehicles resemble
          tombstones."</i

          >"While the lights have turned on in lower Manhattan and limited
          subway access has resumed in parts of Brooklyn, here in Coney Island,
          the recovery has hardly begun. A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the
          future of the Wonder Wheel and the Cyclone roller coaster, the freak
          show, the arcades and the people. For now, rescue workers around the
          city are focused on saving lives, but the government has already begun
          taking stock of property damage. The people of Coney Island are
          worried that this odd, out-of-the-way, and often overlooked place will
          again be forgotten. Like everyone who values the history of this
          American icon, they believe these buildings and rides are worth far
          more than the old materials that they’re made of."</i

          far from completion seven years after Superstorm Sandy devastated
          Coney Island, and what safeguards do exist won’t protect against a
          Sandy-sized storm — leaving residents vulnerable to flooding for years
          to come, according to advocates."</i
