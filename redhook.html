          beginning of the end for the neighborhood. Then he corrected himself:
          'There’s no such thing as a fucking end. But it was the beginning of
          something different.'"

          >"Hurricane Sandy, in 2012, offered a grim preview of Red Hook’s
          future. The storm, which devastated areas all over New York and left
          43 dead in the city, hit Red Hook particularly hard. As water gushed
          out of sewers and into streets, parks and basements, residents were
          forced to remember that Red Hook used to be a tidal marsh and that
          old, hidden creeks still stream under the asphalt like veins under the
          city’s skin."</i

          >"In Red Hook and Sunset Park, AECOM recently [in 2016] released a
          plan to place 30-50,000 units of new housing on the waterfront—25
          percent of it affordable—as well as subsidize a new subway stop, and
          implement green and gray infrastructure for coastal protection and
          flood management. Arguing for the plan as a boost to Mayor de Blasio’s
          OneNYC ambition to build 200,000 affordable units by 2020, the
          proposal also runs counter to the idea of limiting exposure to areas
          of growing risk."</i

          >"The truth is that with the seas around New York pegged to rise by
          several feet by the end of the century, there may be no truly
          long-term future for waterfront neighborhoods like Red Hook—at least,
          no future that resembles the present. 'The only answer is going to be
          to plan for the inevitable on sea-level rise, and that could mean
          retreat from the shoreline,' says Nicolas Coch, a coastal geology
          expert at Queens College in New York. 'But no one wants to think about
          that.'"</i
