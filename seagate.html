          >"As its name suggests, Sea Gate is a gated community. Before the
          storm it was known for its safety. Its beaches are private, and
          separating the neighborhood's relatively affluent suburbs from Coney
          Island's high rises and public housing is a tall chain link fence.
          Residents could enter from two locations, both of which were monitored
          closely by Sea Gate's own police force. Today that security is in
          tatters. The once fortified perimeter is full of holes, which
          Maldonado suspects the looters used to enter Sea Gate. One of the
          community's entrances has been closed and residents driving into Sea
          Gate on Thursday were greeted by police officers warming themselves
          around a burning garbage bin."</i

          not quite abandoned. There are empty lots all along its coast, or
          houses still vacant, and just next door, a brand new building. One
          house might have a nice sea wall, but if its neighbor only has a bunch
          of scrap wood, both places are going to flood together."</i

          face of the probabilities associated with climate change? “Absolutely
          not,” says Keenan. “It’ll be a completely spatial segregation of the
          haves and have nots around their buildings’ engineering capacity and
          the weather.”"</i
