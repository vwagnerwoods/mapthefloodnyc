        This may seem like a promising signal of the city's rebirth, especially
        when considering the havoc that the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked upon its
        communities. However, increased investment in coastal development paints
        a false picture of how vulnerable these very areas are to flooding.

        The content in the map can hopefully act as ground to brainstorm, think
        freely, and reflect. In order to assist with this, viewers are given the
        opportunity to toggle through building data in ways that they can fully
        control.
        <p />
        <p />
        To honor those who have lost their homes, businesses, and communities to
        Hurricane Sandy, a few of the neighborhoods affected by the flooding
        that occurred during the Hurricane have been highlighted in the
        "Neighborhoods of Interest" tab. Each link is supplied with resources
        that viewers can explore and read through should they feel compelled to.
