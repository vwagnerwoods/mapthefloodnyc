Thanks, at least in part, to the power explosion at 14th Street, we won't likely regain electricity for as many as seven days. The howling wind wasn't to blame and neither was the rain, which consisted mostly of mist.  It was the record 13.88-foot storm surge of seawater that barreled across my neighborhood, pouring salt water into the subways and the basements of buildings."</i

Businesses like Morgan Stanley, American International Group Inc., and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP were among those affected by Sandy. Many companies have retreated to Midtown Manhattan or asked their employees to work from home. These are temporary solutions for what has the potential to be a long term problem. "</i
