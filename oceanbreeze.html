          neighborhoods around it were completely devastated, with homes
          destroyed, local residents drowned, and the survivors clearly
          traumatized by the storm. There were hot tubs in trees, homes pushed
          into the middle of the street, cars with their windows busted out by
          the water. In those early days after the storm, it was clear that the
          residents of Ocean Breeze were dedicated to returning and rebuilding
          their community. In the years to come, though, red tape and a slow
          recovery process resulted in another kind of trauma, with residents
          trapped in a homeless limbo. Their frustration was palpable, and
          resulted in most of Ocean Breeze deciding to head in a much different
          direction, agreeing to sell their homes to the New York state
          government, so that their houses could be permanently demolished as
          part of a 'managed retreat.'"</i

        <i
          >It’s a warm and sunny morning in early October 2013, almost a year
          after Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast of the United States. As I
          walk down Seaview Avenue, navigating sidewalks overgrown with weeds
          and tall grass, I smell the ocean before I can see it. I turn the
          corner and see three people arranging hand-painted signs around a
          large white tent. The signs identify them as the Ocean Breeze Buyout
          Committee, one of several resident-led groups on Staten Island that
          are making the case against rebuilding their shorefront neighborhoods.
          Instead, they want the government to buy out their houses, restore
          wetlands, and create open public spaces that would offer protection
          from future storms. They face opposition, not from fellow residents
          who want to stay, but from a New York City administration that wants
          to redevelop rather than retreat from the coast. Every weekend, the
          Ocean Breeze Buyout Committee sets up an information tent and
          encourages passersby to sign letters indicating their interest in a
          buyout. The tent provides a place for residents to gather, to support
          each other, and to speak with journalists and local politicians.
          Today, a crowd gathers quickly. 'I don’t want to live through it
          again,'' one man says to me, adding, 'even if the buyout is a financial
          wash for me, I would prefer the land going back to nature, so it
          doesn’t happen to another family twenty, thirty years down the
          road.'”</i

Just down the street from where Herrnkind used to live, more turkeys mill about on empty lots where homes used to be."</i>
